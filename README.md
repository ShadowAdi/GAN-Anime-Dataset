# **GAN'S Anime Face Generation**

**Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**   are a powerful framework for training generative models, meaning models that can generate new, realistic data samples. The basic idea behind GANs is to have two neural networks, a generator, and a discriminator, that are trained simultaneously through adversarial training.

Generative models aim to learn the underlying distribution of a dataset to generate new samples that resemble the training data. GANs fall under the category of generative models, along with other approaches like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).

**Generator Network:**
The generator is a neural network that takes random noise as input and generates synthetic data samples. The goal of the generator is to produce data that is indistinguishable from real data.

**Discriminator Network:**

The discriminator is another neural network that takes input data (either real or generated) and predicts whether it is real or fake. The goal of the discriminator is to correctly classify real and generated data.

**Adversarial Training:**

The generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously through a competitive process. The generator aims to improve its ability to generate realistic data to fool the discriminator. The discriminator aims to improve its ability to distinguish between real and generated data.

**Objective Function:**

The training process involves minimizing a specific objective function, often referred to as the adversarial loss or minimax loss. The generator and discriminator are involved in a game where the generator tries to minimize the discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and fake data. Training Steps:

During each training step, the generator generates fake data, and the discriminator classifies both real and fake data. The gradients from the discriminator's predictions are backpropagated to update the weights of the discriminator. Simultaneously, the gradients from the generator's output are backpropagated to update the weights of the generator. This process is repeated iteratively until the generator produces realistic data. Convergence:

Ideally, the generator and discriminator reach a point where the generator generates data that is indistinguishable from real data, and the discriminator cannot reliably classify between real and fake data.

Researchers have proposed various GAN variants and improvements to address challenges and enhance performance. Some examples include DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN), WGAN (Wasserstein GAN), and conditional GANs.

## **Dataset I Use**
The Dataset I Use is [The Anime Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/splcher/animefacedataset)...It Contains High Resolution Images Of Many Anime Characters Based On The Dataset Model Tries to Generate New Anime Faces.

I Have Used **DCGAN** For This Task.

I Have Only Run My Model For Only 200 epochs.You Can Also Try On Around 2000 epochs
